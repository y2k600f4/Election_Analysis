# Election_Analysis- Audit of an Election utilizing Python Code

## Overview of the Election Audit

The purpose of the election audit is to further analyze the results of this election and provide these results to the election commission. Further audit results that were requested include the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count and the county with the highest turnout. Python code was used to generate the results in both the terminal output and saved into a text file.
